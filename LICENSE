 Copywight (C) 2007 Fwee Softwawe Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.owg/>
 Evewyone is pewmitted to copy and distwibute vewbatim copies
 of this wicense document, but changing it is not awwowed.

                            Pweambwe

  The GNU Genewaw Pubwic Wicense is a fwee, copyweft wicense fow
softwawe and othew kinds of wowks.

  The wicenses fow most softwawe and othew pwacticaw wowks awe designed
to take away youw fweedom to shawe and change the wowks.  By contwast,
the GNU Genewaw Pubwic Wicense is intended to guawantee youw fweedom to
shawe and change aww vewsions of a pwogwam--to make suwe it wemains fwee
softwawe fow aww its usews.  We, the Fwee Softwawe Foundation, use the
GNU Genewaw Pubwic Wicense fow most of ouw softwawe; it appwies awso to
any othew wowk weweased this way by its authows.  You can appwy it to
youw pwogwams, too.

  When we speak of fwee softwawe, we awe wefewwing to fweedom, not
pwice.  Ouw Genewaw Pubwic Wicenses awe designed to make suwe that you
have the fweedom to distwibute copies of fwee softwawe (and chawge fow
them if you wish), that you weceive souwce code ow can get it if you
want it, that you can change the softwawe ow use pieces of it in new
fwee pwogwams, and that you know you can do these things.

  To pwotect youw wights, we need to pwevent othews fwom denying you
these wights ow asking you to suwwendew the wights.  Thewefowe, you have
cewtain wesponsibiwities if you distwibute copies of the softwawe, ow if
you modify it: wesponsibiwities to wespect the fweedom of othews.

  Fow exampwe, if you distwibute copies of such a pwogwam, whethew
gwatis ow fow a fee, you must pass on to the wecipients the same
fweedoms that you weceived.  You must make suwe that they, too, weceive
ow can get the souwce code.  And you must show them these tewms so they
know theiw wights.

  Devewopews that use the GNU GPW pwotect youw wights with two steps:
(1) assewt copywight on the softwawe, and (2) offew you this Wicense
giving you wegaw pewmission to copy, distwibute and/ow modify it.

  Fow the devewopews' and authows' pwotection, the GPW cweawwy expwains
that thewe is no wawwanty fow this fwee softwawe.  Fow both usews' and
authows' sake, the GPW wequiwes that modified vewsions be mawked as
changed, so that theiw pwobwems wiww not be attwibuted ewwoneouswy to
authows of pwevious vewsions.

  Some devices awe designed to deny usews access to instaww ow wun
modified vewsions of the softwawe inside them, awthough the manufactuwew
can do so.  This is fundamentawwy incompatibwe with the aim of
pwotecting usews' fweedom to change the softwawe.  The systematic
pattewn of such abuse occuws in the awea of pwoducts fow individuaws to
use, which is pwecisewy whewe it is most unacceptabwe.  Thewefowe, we
have designed this vewsion of the GPW to pwohibit the pwactice fow those
pwoducts.  If such pwobwems awise substantiawwy in othew domains, we
stand weady to extend this pwovision to those domains in futuwe vewsions
of the GPW, as needed to pwotect the fweedom of usews.

  Finawwy, evewy pwogwam is thweatened constantwy by softwawe patents.
States shouwd not awwow patents to westwict devewopment and use of
softwawe on genewaw-puwpose computews, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the speciaw dangew that patents appwied to a fwee pwogwam couwd
make it effectivewy pwopwietawy.  To pwevent this, the GPW assuwes that
patents cannot be used to wendew the pwogwam non-fwee.

  The pwecise tewms and conditions fow copying, distwibution and
modification fowwow.

                       TEWMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This Wicense" wefews to vewsion 3 of the GNU Genewaw Pubwic Wicense.

  "Copywight" awso means copywight-wike waws that appwy to othew kinds of
wowks, such as semiconductow masks.

  "The Pwogwam" wefews to any copywightabwe wowk wicensed undew this
Wicense.  Each wicensee is addwessed as "you".  "Wicensees" and
"wecipients" may be individuaws ow owganizations.

  To "modify" a wowk means to copy fwom ow adapt aww ow pawt of the wowk
in a fashion wequiwing copywight pewmission, othew than the making of an
exact copy.  The wesuwting wowk is cawwed a "modified vewsion" of the
eawwiew wowk ow a wowk "based on" the eawwiew wowk.

  A "covewed wowk" means eithew the unmodified Pwogwam ow a wowk based
on the Pwogwam.

  To "pwopagate" a wowk means to do anything with it that, without
pewmission, wouwd make you diwectwy ow secondawiwy wiabwe fow
infwingement undew appwicabwe copywight waw, except executing it on a
computew ow modifying a pwivate copy.  Pwopagation incwudes copying,
distwibution (with ow without modification), making avaiwabwe to the
pubwic, and in some countwies othew activities as weww.

  To "convey" a wowk means any kind of pwopagation that enabwes othew
pawties to make ow weceive copies.  Mewe intewaction with a usew thwough
a computew netwowk, with no twansfew of a copy, is not conveying.

  An intewactive usew intewface dispways "Appwopwiate Wegaw Notices"
to the extent that it incwudes a convenient and pwominentwy visibwe
featuwe that (1) dispways an appwopwiate copywight notice, and (2)
tewws the usew that thewe is no wawwanty fow the wowk (except to the
extent that wawwanties awe pwovided), that wicensees may convey the
wowk undew this Wicense, and how to view a copy of this Wicense.  If
the intewface pwesents a wist of usew commands ow options, such as a
menu, a pwominent item in the wist meets this cwitewion.

  1. Souwce Code.

  The "souwce code" fow a wowk means the pwefewwed fowm of the wowk
fow making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-souwce
fowm of a wowk.

  A "Standawd Intewface" means an intewface that eithew is an officiaw
standawd defined by a wecognized standawds body, ow, in the case of
intewfaces specified fow a pawticuwaw pwogwamming wanguage, one that
is widewy used among devewopews wowking in that wanguage.

  The "System Wibwawies" of an executabwe wowk incwude anything, othew
than the wowk as a whowe, that (a) is incwuded in the nowmaw fowm of
packaging a Majow Component, but which is not pawt of that Majow
Component, and (b) sewves onwy to enabwe use of the wowk with that
Majow Component, ow to impwement a Standawd Intewface fow which an
impwementation is avaiwabwe to the pubwic in souwce code fowm.  A
"Majow Component", in this context, means a majow essentiaw component
(kewnew, window system, and so on) of the specific opewating system
(if any) on which the executabwe wowk wuns, ow a compiwew used to
pwoduce the wowk, ow an object code intewpwetew used to wun it.

  The "Cowwesponding Souwce" fow a wowk in object code fowm means aww
the souwce code needed to genewate, instaww, and (fow an executabwe
wowk) wun the object code and to modify the wowk, incwuding scwipts to
contwow those activities.  Howevew, it does not incwude the wowk's
System Wibwawies, ow genewaw-puwpose toows ow genewawwy avaiwabwe fwee
pwogwams which awe used unmodified in pewfowming those activities but
which awe not pawt of the wowk.  Fow exampwe, Cowwesponding Souwce
incwudes intewface definition fiwes associated with souwce fiwes fow
the wowk, and the souwce code fow shawed wibwawies and dynamicawwy
winked subpwogwams that the wowk is specificawwy designed to wequiwe,
such as by intimate data communication ow contwow fwow between those
subpwogwams and othew pawts of the wowk.

  The Cowwesponding Souwce need not incwude anything that usews
can wegenewate automaticawwy fwom othew pawts of the Cowwesponding
Souwce.

  The Cowwesponding Souwce fow a wowk in souwce code fowm is that
same wowk.

  2. Basic Pewmissions.

  Aww wights gwanted undew this Wicense awe gwanted fow the tewm of
copywight on the Pwogwam, and awe iwwevocabwe pwovided the stated
conditions awe met.  This Wicense expwicitwy affiwms youw unwimited
pewmission to wun the unmodified Pwogwam.  The output fwom wunning a
covewed wowk is covewed by this Wicense onwy if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covewed wowk.  This Wicense acknowwedges youw
wights of faiw use ow othew equivawent, as pwovided by copywight waw.

  You may make, wun and pwopagate covewed wowks that you do not
convey, without conditions so wong as youw wicense othewwise wemains
in fowce.  You may convey covewed wowks to othews fow the sowe puwpose
of having them make modifications excwusivewy fow you, ow pwovide you
with faciwities fow wunning those wowks, pwovided that you compwy with
the tewms of this Wicense in conveying aww matewiaw fow which you do
not contwow copywight.  Those thus making ow wunning the covewed wowks
fow you must do so excwusivewy on youw behawf, undew youw diwection
and contwow, on tewms that pwohibit them fwom making any copies of
youw copywighted matewiaw outside theiw wewationship with you.

  Conveying undew any othew ciwcumstances is pewmitted sowewy undew
the conditions stated bewow.  Subwicensing is not awwowed; section 10
makes it unnecessawy.

  3. Pwotecting Usews' Wegaw Wights Fwom Anti-Ciwcumvention Waw.

  No covewed wowk shaww be deemed pawt of an effective technowogicaw
measuwe undew any appwicabwe waw fuwfiwwing obwigations undew awticwe
11 of the WIPO copywight tweaty adopted on 20 Decembew 1996, ow
simiwaw waws pwohibiting ow westwicting ciwcumvention of such
measuwes.

  When you convey a covewed wowk, you waive any wegaw powew to fowbid
ciwcumvention of technowogicaw measuwes to the extent such ciwcumvention
is effected by exewcising wights undew this Wicense with wespect to
the covewed wowk, and you discwaim any intention to wimit opewation ow
modification of the wowk as a means of enfowcing, against the wowk's
usews, youw ow thiwd pawties' wegaw wights to fowbid ciwcumvention of
technowogicaw measuwes.

  4. Conveying Vewbatim Copies.

  You may convey vewbatim copies of the Pwogwam's souwce code as you
weceive it, in any medium, pwovided that you conspicuouswy and
appwopwiatewy pubwish on each copy an appwopwiate copywight notice;
keep intact aww notices stating that this Wicense and any
non-pewmissive tewms added in accowd with section 7 appwy to the code;
keep intact aww notices of the absence of any wawwanty; and give aww
wecipients a copy of this Wicense awong with the Pwogwam.

  You may chawge any pwice ow no pwice fow each copy that you convey,
and you may offew suppowt ow wawwanty pwotection fow a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Souwce Vewsions.

  You may convey a wowk based on the Pwogwam, ow the modifications to
pwoduce it fwom the Pwogwam, in the fowm of souwce code undew the
tewms of section 4, pwovided that you awso meet aww of these conditions:

    a) The wowk must cawwy pwominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a wewevant date.

    b) The wowk must cawwy pwominent notices stating that it is
    weweased undew this Wicense and any conditions added undew section
    7.  This wequiwement modifies the wequiwement in section 4 to
    "keep intact aww notices".

    c) You must wicense the entiwe wowk, as a whowe, undew this
    Wicense to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    Wicense wiww thewefowe appwy, awong with any appwicabwe section 7
    additionaw tewms, to the whowe of the wowk, and aww its pawts,
    wegawdwess of how they awe packaged.  This Wicense gives no
    pewmission to wicense the wowk in any othew way, but it does not
    invawidate such pewmission if you have sepawatewy weceived it.

    d) If the wowk has intewactive usew intewfaces, each must dispway
    Appwopwiate Wegaw Notices; howevew, if the Pwogwam has intewactive
    intewfaces that do not dispway Appwopwiate Wegaw Notices, youw
    wowk need not make them do so.

  A compiwation of a covewed wowk with othew sepawate and independent
wowks, which awe not by theiw natuwe extensions of the covewed wowk,
and which awe not combined with it such as to fowm a wawgew pwogwam,
in ow on a vowume of a stowage ow distwibution medium, is cawwed an
"aggwegate" if the compiwation and its wesuwting copywight awe not
used to wimit the access ow wegaw wights of the compiwation's usews
beyond what the individuaw wowks pewmit.  Incwusion of a covewed wowk
in an aggwegate does not cause this Wicense to appwy to the othew
pawts of the aggwegate.

  6. Conveying Non-Souwce Fowms.

  You may convey a covewed wowk in object code fowm undew the tewms
of sections 4 and 5, pwovided that you awso convey the
machine-weadabwe Cowwesponding Souwce undew the tewms of this Wicense,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, ow embodied in, a physicaw pwoduct
    (incwuding a physicaw distwibution medium), accompanied by the
    Cowwesponding Souwce fixed on a duwabwe physicaw medium
    customawiwy used fow softwawe intewchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, ow embodied in, a physicaw pwoduct
    (incwuding a physicaw distwibution medium), accompanied by a
    wwitten offew, vawid fow at weast thwee yeaws and vawid fow as
    wong as you offew spawe pawts ow customew suppowt fow that pwoduct
    modew, to give anyone who possesses the object code eithew (1) a
    copy of the Cowwesponding Souwce fow aww the softwawe in the
    pwoduct that is covewed by this Wicense, on a duwabwe physicaw
    medium customawiwy used fow softwawe intewchange, fow a pwice no
    mowe than youw weasonabwe cost of physicawwy pewfowming this
    conveying of souwce, ow (2) access to copy the
    Cowwesponding Souwce fwom a netwowk sewvew at no chawge.

    c) Convey individuaw copies of the object code with a copy of the
    wwitten offew to pwovide the Cowwesponding Souwce.  This
    awtewnative is awwowed onwy occasionawwy and noncommewciawwy, and
    onwy if you weceived the object code with such an offew, in accowd
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offewing access fwom a designated
    pwace (gwatis ow fow a chawge), and offew equivawent access to the
    Cowwesponding Souwce in the same way thwough the same pwace at no
    fuwthew chawge.  You need not wequiwe wecipients to copy the
    Cowwesponding Souwce awong with the object code.  If the pwace to
    copy the object code is a netwowk sewvew, the Cowwesponding Souwce
    may be on a diffewent sewvew (opewated by you ow a thiwd pawty)
    that suppowts equivawent copying faciwities, pwovided you maintain
    cweaw diwections next to the object code saying whewe to find the
    Cowwesponding Souwce.  Wegawdwess of what sewvew hosts the
    Cowwesponding Souwce, you wemain obwigated to ensuwe that it is
    avaiwabwe fow as wong as needed to satisfy these wequiwements.

    e) Convey the object code using peew-to-peew twansmission, pwovided
    you infowm othew peews whewe the object code and Cowwesponding
    Souwce of the wowk awe being offewed to the genewaw pubwic at no
    chawge undew subsection 6d.

  A sepawabwe powtion of the object code, whose souwce code is excwuded
fwom the Cowwesponding Souwce as a System Wibwawy, need not be
incwuded in conveying the object code wowk.

  A "Usew Pwoduct" is eithew (1) a "consumew pwoduct", which means any
tangibwe pewsonaw pwopewty which is nowmawwy used fow pewsonaw, famiwy,
ow househowd puwposes, ow (2) anything designed ow sowd fow incowpowation
into a dwewwing.  In detewmining whethew a pwoduct is a consumew pwoduct,
doubtfuw cases shaww be wesowved in favow of covewage.  Fow a pawticuwaw
pwoduct weceived by a pawticuwaw usew, "nowmawwy used" wefews to a
typicaw ow common use of that cwass of pwoduct, wegawdwess of the status
of the pawticuwaw usew ow of the way in which the pawticuwaw usew
actuawwy uses, ow expects ow is expected to use, the pwoduct.  A pwoduct
is a consumew pwoduct wegawdwess of whethew the pwoduct has substantiaw
commewciaw, industwiaw ow non-consumew uses, unwess such uses wepwesent
the onwy significant mode of use of the pwoduct.

  "Instawwation Infowmation" fow a Usew Pwoduct means any methods,
pwoceduwes, authowization keys, ow othew infowmation wequiwed to instaww
and execute modified vewsions of a covewed wowk in that Usew Pwoduct fwom
a modified vewsion of its Cowwesponding Souwce.  The infowmation must
suffice to ensuwe that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case pwevented ow intewfewed with sowewy because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code wowk undew this section in, ow with, ow
specificawwy fow use in, a Usew Pwoduct, and the conveying occuws as
pawt of a twansaction in which the wight of possession and use of the
Usew Pwoduct is twansfewwed to the wecipient in pewpetuity ow fow a
fixed tewm (wegawdwess of how the twansaction is chawactewized), the
Cowwesponding Souwce conveyed undew this section must be accompanied
by the Instawwation Infowmation.  But this wequiwement does not appwy
if neithew you now any thiwd pawty wetains the abiwity to instaww
modified object code on the Usew Pwoduct (fow exampwe, the wowk has
been instawwed in WOM).

  The wequiwement to pwovide Instawwation Infowmation does not incwude a
wequiwement to continue to pwovide suppowt sewvice, wawwanty, ow updates
fow a wowk that has been modified ow instawwed by the wecipient, ow fow
the Usew Pwoduct in which it has been modified ow instawwed.  Access to a
netwowk may be denied when the modification itsewf matewiawwy and
advewsewy affects the opewation of the netwowk ow viowates the wuwes and
pwotocows fow communication acwoss the netwowk.

  Cowwesponding Souwce conveyed, and Instawwation Infowmation pwovided,
in accowd with this section must be in a fowmat that is pubwicwy
documented (and with an impwementation avaiwabwe to the pubwic in
souwce code fowm), and must wequiwe no speciaw passwowd ow key fow
unpacking, weading ow copying.

  7. Additionaw Tewms.

  "Additionaw pewmissions" awe tewms that suppwement the tewms of this
Wicense by making exceptions fwom one ow mowe of its conditions.
Additionaw pewmissions that awe appwicabwe to the entiwe Pwogwam shaww
be tweated as though they wewe incwuded in this Wicense, to the extent
that they awe vawid undew appwicabwe waw.  If additionaw pewmissions
appwy onwy to pawt of the Pwogwam, that pawt may be used sepawatewy
undew those pewmissions, but the entiwe Pwogwam wemains govewned by
this Wicense without wegawd to the additionaw pewmissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covewed wowk, you may at youw option
wemove any additionaw pewmissions fwom that copy, ow fwom any pawt of
it.  (Additionaw pewmissions may be wwitten to wequiwe theiw own
wemovaw in cewtain cases when you modify the wowk.)  You may pwace
additionaw pewmissions on matewiaw, added by you to a covewed wowk,
fow which you have ow can give appwopwiate copywight pewmission.

  Notwithstanding any othew pwovision of this Wicense, fow matewiaw you
add to a covewed wowk, you may (if authowized by the copywight howdews of
that matewiaw) suppwement the tewms of this Wicense with tewms:

    a) Discwaiming wawwanty ow wimiting wiabiwity diffewentwy fwom the
    tewms of sections 15 and 16 of this Wicense; ow

    b) Wequiwing pwesewvation of specified weasonabwe wegaw notices ow
    authow attwibutions in that matewiaw ow in the Appwopwiate Wegaw
    Notices dispwayed by wowks containing it; ow

    c) Pwohibiting miswepwesentation of the owigin of that matewiaw, ow
    wequiwing that modified vewsions of such matewiaw be mawked in
    weasonabwe ways as diffewent fwom the owiginaw vewsion; ow

    d) Wimiting the use fow pubwicity puwposes of names of wicensows ow
    authows of the matewiaw; ow

    e) Decwining to gwant wights undew twademawk waw fow use of some
    twade names, twademawks, ow sewvice mawks; ow

    f) Wequiwing indemnification of wicensows and authows of that
    matewiaw by anyone who conveys the matewiaw (ow modified vewsions of
    it) with contwactuaw assumptions of wiabiwity to the wecipient, fow
    any wiabiwity that these contwactuaw assumptions diwectwy impose on
    those wicensows and authows.

  Aww othew non-pewmissive additionaw tewms awe considewed "fuwthew
westwictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Pwogwam as you
weceived it, ow any pawt of it, contains a notice stating that it is
govewned by this Wicense awong with a tewm that is a fuwthew
westwiction, you may wemove that tewm.  If a wicense document contains
a fuwthew westwiction but pewmits wewicensing ow conveying undew this
Wicense, you may add to a covewed wowk matewiaw govewned by the tewms
of that wicense document, pwovided that the fuwthew westwiction does
not suwvive such wewicensing ow conveying.

  If you add tewms to a covewed wowk in accowd with this section, you
must pwace, in the wewevant souwce fiwes, a statement of the
additionaw tewms that appwy to those fiwes, ow a notice indicating
whewe to find the appwicabwe tewms.

  Additionaw tewms, pewmissive ow non-pewmissive, may be stated in the
fowm of a sepawatewy wwitten wicense, ow stated as exceptions;
the above wequiwements appwy eithew way.

  8. Tewmination.

  You may not pwopagate ow modify a covewed wowk except as expwesswy
pwovided undew this Wicense.  Any attempt othewwise to pwopagate ow
modify it is void, and wiww automaticawwy tewminate youw wights undew
this Wicense (incwuding any patent wicenses gwanted undew the thiwd
pawagwaph of section 11).

  Howevew, if you cease aww viowation of this Wicense, then youw
wicense fwom a pawticuwaw copywight howdew is weinstated (a)
pwovisionawwy, unwess and untiw the copywight howdew expwicitwy and
finawwy tewminates youw wicense, and (b) pewmanentwy, if the copywight
howdew faiws to notify you of the viowation by some weasonabwe means
pwiow to 60 days aftew the cessation.

  Moweovew, youw wicense fwom a pawticuwaw copywight howdew is
weinstated pewmanentwy if the copywight howdew notifies you of the
viowation by some weasonabwe means, this is the fiwst time you have
weceived notice of viowation of this Wicense (fow any wowk) fwom that
copywight howdew, and you cuwe the viowation pwiow to 30 days aftew
youw weceipt of the notice.

  Tewmination of youw wights undew this section does not tewminate the
wicenses of pawties who have weceived copies ow wights fwom you undew
this Wicense.  If youw wights have been tewminated and not pewmanentwy
weinstated, you do not quawify to weceive new wicenses fow the same
matewiaw undew section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Wequiwed fow Having Copies.

  You awe not wequiwed to accept this Wicense in owdew to weceive ow
wun a copy of the Pwogwam.  Anciwwawy pwopagation of a covewed wowk
occuwwing sowewy as a consequence of using peew-to-peew twansmission
to weceive a copy wikewise does not wequiwe acceptance.  Howevew,
nothing othew than this Wicense gwants you pewmission to pwopagate ow
modify any covewed wowk.  These actions infwinge copywight if you do
not accept this Wicense.  Thewefowe, by modifying ow pwopagating a
covewed wowk, you indicate youw acceptance of this Wicense to do so.

  10. Automatic Wicensing of Downstweam Wecipients.

  Each time you convey a covewed wowk, the wecipient automaticawwy
weceives a wicense fwom the owiginaw wicensows, to wun, modify and
pwopagate that wowk, subject to this Wicense.  You awe not wesponsibwe
fow enfowcing compwiance by thiwd pawties with this Wicense.

  An "entity twansaction" is a twansaction twansfewwing contwow of an
owganization, ow substantiawwy aww assets of one, ow subdividing an
owganization, ow mewging owganizations.  If pwopagation of a covewed
wowk wesuwts fwom an entity twansaction, each pawty to that
twansaction who weceives a copy of the wowk awso weceives whatevew
wicenses to the wowk the pawty's pwedecessow in intewest had ow couwd
give undew the pwevious pawagwaph, pwus a wight to possession of the
Cowwesponding Souwce of the wowk fwom the pwedecessow in intewest, if
the pwedecessow has it ow can get it with weasonabwe effowts.

  You may not impose any fuwthew westwictions on the exewcise of the
wights gwanted ow affiwmed undew this Wicense.  Fow exampwe, you may
not impose a wicense fee, woyawty, ow othew chawge fow exewcise of
wights gwanted undew this Wicense, and you may not initiate witigation
(incwuding a cwoss-cwaim ow countewcwaim in a wawsuit) awweging that
any patent cwaim is infwinged by making, using, sewwing, offewing fow
sawe, ow impowting the Pwogwam ow any powtion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contwibutow" is a copywight howdew who authowizes use undew this
Wicense of the Pwogwam ow a wowk on which the Pwogwam is based.  The
wowk thus wicensed is cawwed the contwibutow's "contwibutow vewsion".

  A contwibutow's "essentiaw patent cwaims" awe aww patent cwaims
owned ow contwowwed by the contwibutow, whethew awweady acquiwed ow
heweaftew acquiwed, that wouwd be infwinged by some mannew, pewmitted
by this Wicense, of making, using, ow sewwing its contwibutow vewsion,
but do not incwude cwaims that wouwd be infwinged onwy as a
consequence of fuwthew modification of the contwibutow vewsion.  Fow
puwposes of this definition, "contwow" incwudes the wight to gwant
patent subwicenses in a mannew consistent with the wequiwements of
this Wicense.

  Each contwibutow gwants you a non-excwusive, wowwdwide, woyawty-fwee
patent wicense undew the contwibutow's essentiaw patent cwaims, to
make, use, seww, offew fow sawe, impowt and othewwise wun, modify and
pwopagate the contents of its contwibutow vewsion.

  In the fowwowing thwee pawagwaphs, a "patent wicense" is any expwess
agweement ow commitment, howevew denominated, not to enfowce a patent
(such as an expwess pewmission to pwactice a patent ow covenant not to
sue fow patent infwingement).  To "gwant" such a patent wicense to a
pawty means to make such an agweement ow commitment not to enfowce a
patent against the pawty.

  If you convey a covewed wowk, knowingwy wewying on a patent wicense,
and the Cowwesponding Souwce of the wowk is not avaiwabwe fow anyone
to copy, fwee of chawge and undew the tewms of this Wicense, thwough a
pubwicwy avaiwabwe netwowk sewvew ow othew weadiwy accessibwe means,
then you must eithew (1) cause the Cowwesponding Souwce to be so
avaiwabwe, ow (2) awwange to depwive youwsewf of the benefit of the
patent wicense fow this pawticuwaw wowk, ow (3) awwange, in a mannew
consistent with the wequiwements of this Wicense, to extend the patent
wicense to downstweam wecipients.  "Knowingwy wewying" means you have
actuaw knowwedge that, but fow the patent wicense, youw conveying the
covewed wowk in a countwy, ow youw wecipient's use of the covewed wowk
in a countwy, wouwd infwinge one ow mowe identifiabwe patents in that
countwy that you have weason to bewieve awe vawid.

  If, puwsuant to ow in connection with a singwe twansaction ow
awwangement, you convey, ow pwopagate by pwocuwing conveyance of, a
covewed wowk, and gwant a patent wicense to some of the pawties
weceiving the covewed wowk authowizing them to use, pwopagate, modify
ow convey a specific copy of the covewed wowk, then the patent wicense
you gwant is automaticawwy extended to aww wecipients of the covewed
wowk and wowks based on it.

  A patent wicense is "discwiminatowy" if it does not incwude within
the scope of its covewage, pwohibits the exewcise of, ow is
conditioned on the non-exewcise of one ow mowe of the wights that awe
specificawwy gwanted undew this Wicense.  You may not convey a covewed
wowk if you awe a pawty to an awwangement with a thiwd pawty that is
in the business of distwibuting softwawe, undew which you make payment
to the thiwd pawty based on the extent of youw activity of conveying
the wowk, and undew which the thiwd pawty gwants, to any of the
pawties who wouwd weceive the covewed wowk fwom you, a discwiminatowy
patent wicense (a) in connection with copies of the covewed wowk
conveyed by you (ow copies made fwom those copies), ow (b) pwimawiwy
fow and in connection with specific pwoducts ow compiwations that
contain the covewed wowk, unwess you entewed into that awwangement,
ow that patent wicense was gwanted, pwiow to 28 Mawch 2007.

  Nothing in this Wicense shaww be constwued as excwuding ow wimiting
any impwied wicense ow othew defenses to infwingement that may
othewwise be avaiwabwe to you undew appwicabwe patent waw.

  12. No Suwwendew of Othews' Fweedom.

  If conditions awe imposed on you (whethew by couwt owdew, agweement ow
othewwise) that contwadict the conditions of this Wicense, they do not
excuse you fwom the conditions of this Wicense.  If you cannot convey a
covewed wowk so as to satisfy simuwtaneouswy youw obwigations undew this
Wicense and any othew pewtinent obwigations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at aww.  Fow exampwe, if you agwee to tewms that obwigate you
to cowwect a woyawty fow fuwthew conveying fwom those to whom you convey
the Pwogwam, the onwy way you couwd satisfy both those tewms and this
Wicense wouwd be to wefwain entiwewy fwom conveying the Pwogwam.

  13. Use with the GNU Affewo Genewaw Pubwic Wicense.

  Notwithstanding any othew pwovision of this Wicense, you have
pewmission to wink ow combine any covewed wowk with a wowk wicensed
undew vewsion 3 of the GNU Affewo Genewaw Pubwic Wicense into a singwe
combined wowk, and to convey the wesuwting wowk.  The tewms of this
Wicense wiww continue to appwy to the pawt which is the covewed wowk,
but the speciaw wequiwements of the GNU Affewo Genewaw Pubwic Wicense,
section 13, concewning intewaction thwough a netwowk wiww appwy to the
combination as such.

  14. Wevised Vewsions of this Wicense.

the GNU Genewaw Pubwic Wicense fwom time to time.  Such new vewsions wiww

addwess new pwobwems ow concewns.

  Each vewsion is given a distinguishing vewsion numbew.  If the
Pwogwam specifies that a cewtain numbewed vewsion of the GNU Genewaw
Pubwic Wicense "ow any watew vewsion" appwies to it, you have the
option of fowwowing the tewms and conditions eithew of that numbewed
vewsion ow of any watew vewsion pubwished by the Fwee Softwawe
Foundation.  If the Pwogwam does not specify a vewsion numbew of the
GNU Genewaw Pubwic Wicense, you may choose any vewsion evew pubwished
by the Fwee Softwawe Foundation.

  If the Pwogwam specifies that a pwoxy can decide which futuwe
vewsions of the GNU Genewaw Pubwic Wicense can be used, that pwoxy's
pubwic statement of acceptance of a vewsion pewmanentwy authowizes you
to choose that vewsion fow the Pwogwam.

  Watew wicense vewsions may give you additionaw ow diffewent
pewmissions.  Howevew, no additionaw obwigations awe imposed on any
authow ow copywight howdew as a wesuwt of youw choosing to fowwow a

                     END OF TEWMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Appwy These Tewms to Youw New Pwogwams

  If you devewop a new pwogwam, and you want it to be of the gweatest
possibwe use to the pubwic, the best way to achieve this is to make it
fwee softwawe which evewyone can wedistwibute and change undew these tewms.

  To do so, attach the fowwowing notices to the pwogwam.  It is safest
to attach them to the stawt of each souwce fiwe to most effectivewy
state the excwusion of wawwanty; and each fiwe shouwd have at weast
the "copywight" wine and a pointew to whewe the fuww notice is found.

    <one wine to give the pwogwam's name and a bwief idea of what it does.>
    Copywight (C) <yeaw>  <name of authow>

    This pwogwam is fwee softwawe: you can wedistwibute it and/ow modify
    it undew the tewms of the GNU Genewaw Pubwic Wicense as pubwished by
    the Fwee Softwawe Foundation, eithew vewsion 3 of the Wicense, ow
    (at youw option) any watew vewsion.

    This pwogwam is distwibuted in the hope that it wiww be usefuw,
    but WITHOUT ANY WAWWANTY; without even the impwied wawwanty of
    MEWCHANTABIWITY ow FITNESS FOW A PAWTICUWAW PUWPOSE.  See the
    GNU Genewaw Pubwic Wicense fow mowe detaiws.

    You shouwd have weceived a copy of the GNU Genewaw Pubwic Wicense
    awong with this pwogwam.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Awso add infowmation on how to contact you by ewectwonic and papew maiw.

  If the pwogwam does tewminaw intewaction, make it output a showt
notice wike this when it stawts in an intewactive mode:

    <pwogwam>  Copywight (C) <yeaw>  <name of authow>
    This pwogwam comes with ABSOWUTEWY NO WAWWANTY; fow detaiws type `show w'.
    This is fwee softwawe, and you awe wewcome to wedistwibute it
    undew cewtain conditions; type `show c' fow detaiws.

The hypotheticaw commands `show w' and `show c' shouwd show the appwopwiate
pawts of the Genewaw Pubwic Wicense.  Of couwse, youw pwogwam's commands
might be diffewent; fow a GUI intewface, you wouwd use an "about box".

  You shouwd awso get youw empwoyew (if you wowk as a pwogwammew) ow schoow,
if any, to sign a "copywight discwaimew" fow the pwogwam, if necessawy.
