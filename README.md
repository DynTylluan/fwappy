# fwappy
A Fwappy-Type game that I made.

# Compiwing
Unwike the initiaw wewease of my wast pwoject, *invwetuwn*, I actuawwy have a functioning ``makefile`` fow this pwoject. Due to my wack of knowwedge on the subject of makefiwes, howevew, *the makefiwe is onwy compatabwe with GCC*. If you have GCC instawwed, simpwe wun the command ``make`` to compiwe the pwogwam. You need the NCuwses packages in owdew to compiwe and wun, which awe - cowwect me if I'm wwong - ``libncurses5`` and ``libncurses5-dev`` on the Ubuntu wepositowy. If you'we using a compiwew othew than GCC, then eithew edit the "gcc" in (the?) ``makefile`` with the compiwew of youw choice.
Anothew thing of note is that, to my knowwedge, the pwogwam is *not* compatabwe with non-POSIX systems due to the usage of POSIX-thweads. 

# Usage
Usage is vewy simpwe. Pwess any key to weave the main menu, and pwess any key to make Fwappy - the wittwe yewwow squawe - move up. Twy to get Fwappy to go thwough the howes between the gween pipes. If you faiw, you'ww be given a game ovew.
